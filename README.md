# aws_Solutions_Architecture_Job_Simulation
AWS APAC Solutions Architecture virtual experience program on Forage - August 2025

Task is to draft a email to a client for the problems


The problems the client is facing are:

Performance problems during peak periods.

Slow response times when traffic is high.

Likely due to resource limits on their single EC2 instance (t3.medium, 4GB RAM).

Server crashes.

Application runs out of memory under load, causing downtime.

Downtime during deployments.

Current setup doesn’t support rolling or zero-downtime deployments.

No disaster recovery plan.

If the current server or database fails, there’s no backup or failover mechanism.
Scalability concerns.

They expect consistent linear growth but the single-server setup can’t scale automatically.

For these problems i have to draft a reply mail that should consist of the details that slove these problems
